# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) project! In this project, we'll explore the fundamental concepts of OOP using Python. Whether you're new to OOP or want to deepen your understanding, this project will guide you through the essentials.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you'll be able to:

- Understand why Python programming is awesome.
- Grasp the core principles of OOP.
- Differentiate between classes, objects, and instances.
- Define attributes and explore public, protected, and private attributes.
- Utilize the special `__init__` method.
- Implement data abstraction, encapsulation, and information hiding.
- Work with properties and understand their role.
- Write Pythonic getters and setters.
- Dynamically create new attributes for existing instances.
- Explore the `__dict__` attribute of classes and instances.
- Use the `getattr` function effectively.

## Resources

Before diving into the project, make sure to read or watch the following resources in the specified order:

1. [Object Oriented Programming](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html) (Read everything until the paragraph "Inheritance" excluded. You don't need to learn about class attributes, class methods, and static methods yet.)
2. [Object-Oriented Programming](https://python-textbok.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/Object_Oriented_Programming.html) (Pay attention to the concepts presented in the following paragraphs: General Introduction, First-class Everything, A Minimal Class in Python, Attributes, Methods, The `__init__` Method, "Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding," and "Public, Protected, and Private Attributes.")
3. [Properties vs. Getters and Setters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCzT9XFZ5bw)
4. [Learn to Program 9: Object Oriented Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AGyBuVCTeE)
5. [Python Classes and Objects](https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/)

## Requirements

- **Operating System:** Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- **Python Version:** 3.8.5
- **Code Style:** PEP 8 (Use `pycodestyle` for linting)
- **Documentation:**
  - Each module, class, and method must have a docstring (Google Style Python Docstrings).
  - Explain the purpose of the module, class, or method in complete sentences.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Explore the provided Python files and follow the learning objectives.
3. Experiment with OOP concepts and play with the code
