# Python Basics

This repository contains Python scripts and shell scripts for various tasks. It covers fundamental concepts of Python programming, including printing, string manipulation, indexing, and adhering to the official Python coding style.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to explain the following topics without relying on external resources:

### General Python Knowledge
- Why Python programming is awesome
- Who created Python
- Who is Guido van Rossum
- The origin of the name 'Python'
- Understanding the Zen of Python
- How to use the Python interpreter
- Printing text and variables using `print`
- Working with strings
- Indexing and slicing in Python
- The official Python coding style and how to check your code with `pycodestyle`

### Project Requirements
- Python scripts should be compatible with Python 3.8.5 and run on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
- All Python files must end with a new line.
- The first line of each Python file should be `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- A `README.md` file at the root of the repository provides a description of the project.
- Your code should adhere to the PEP 8 style guide (using `pycodestyle` version 2.7.*).
- All Python files must be executable.
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`.
- Shell scripts should be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
- All shell scripts should be exactly two lines long (verified by `wc -l`).
- All shell files must end with a new line.
- The first line of each shell script should be `#!/bin/bash`.
- All shell files must be executable.
