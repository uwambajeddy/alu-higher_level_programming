# Project Title

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you will be able to explain the following concepts without the help of Google:

1. **Why Python Programming Is Awesome**
   - Python's readability, versatility, and extensive libraries make it an excellent choice for various applications.
   - Its syntax is straightforward and expressive, allowing developers to write concise and efficient code.

2. **Difference Between Errors and Exceptions**
   - **Errors**: Critical issues that cause a program to stop executing (e.g., syntax errors, logical errors).
   - **Exceptions**: Unanticipated events during runtime that can be caught and handled (e.g., division by zero, key not found).

3. **What Are Exceptions and How to Use Them**
   - Exceptions are unexpected events that disrupt normal program flow.
   - We use `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks to handle exceptions.

4. **When to Use Exceptions**
   - Use exceptions when you expect specific conditions that might cause errors.
   - They allow graceful handling of unexpected situations.

5. **How to Correctly Handle an Exception**
   - Use `try` to enclose code that might raise an exception.
   - Use `except` to catch specific exceptions and handle them appropriately.
   - Use `finally` for cleanup actions (e.g., closing files, releasing resources).

6. **Purpose of Catching Exceptions**
   - Catching exceptions prevents program crashes and allows graceful recovery.
   - It helps maintain program stability and user experience.

7. **How to Raise a Built-in Exception**
   - Use `raise` to create custom exceptions for specific conditions.

8. **When to Implement Clean-Up Actions After an Exception**
   - Use `finally` to ensure specific actions (e.g., closing files, releasing resources) are performed, regardless of exceptions.

## Requirements

### General
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3 (version 3.8.5)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the project folder, is mandatory
- Your code should follow the PEP 8 style guide (use `pycodestyle` version 2.7.*)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
